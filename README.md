Reach Gateway (ActiveMerchant)
================================================================================
Reach (https://withreach.com/) is a global payment processor. If you see things
that reference GoInterpay its because they recently changed their name.

This file was written and menat for Ruby on Rails applications.


Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because ActiveMerchant isn't accpeting any new gateways, I figured it might be
helpful to someone to add it here.

Ensure that ActiveMerchant is installed:

```ruby
gem 'activemerchant'
```

To use this file copy it to your /lib/active_merchant/billing/ folder.
